# nameof

A simple and handy tool to find the name of a student from command line using their Institute ID

## What can it do?

This is a command line tool whch can give you the name of any student from the batch of 2018-2022 by their institute ID.

## Why I built it?

Considering the strength of our batch and the fact that almost every academic activity involves our ID's, it sometimes becomes difficult to identify and find people by their ID's. Hence I've buit this command line tool to find names from ID.
